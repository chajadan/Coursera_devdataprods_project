## What It's For

Did you ever really want to know how many b's were in the preamble to the constitution? Or which letter occurs most frequently in Mississippi? Well maybe not, but it's rather common to eventually want to know the character frequency of some text, and if it's longer than the word Mississippi, letting a computer do it is likely what you want.

## Not Just Useful But FUN!

Character frequencies are interesting. Just yesterday I discovered something about the frequency of the letters of my name, "Charles J. Daniels"

![plot of chunk unnamed-chunk-1](assets/fig/unnamed-chunk-1.png) 

All the letters occur either once or twice. I showed my mom and we analyzed several names, including hers and her mom's (my grandma). It turns out the quirks of my name's character frequencies aren't so rare, which makes sense upon reflection.
